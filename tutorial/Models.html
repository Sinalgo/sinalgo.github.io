            The models are a plug-in based system to describe the environment in
            which the network is simulated. E.g. the mobility model describes how
            the nodes move in the synchronous simulation mode. Each node object
            carries an instance of the following four models: Connectivity,
            Mobility, Interference, and Reliability. As a result, the nodes may
            carry different model implementation and may act differently. The
            message-transmission model describes how long the messages travel
            until arrival. This model applies globally, the framework only holds
            one instance. Finally, the distribution model describes how the nodes
            are placed in the deployment upon creation.

            <h2>Connectivity Model<a name="Connectivity Model"></a></h2>
            <!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

            The connectivity model decides to which neighbors a node has a
            connection and inserts/removes the edges. To write your own
            connectivity model, create a subclass of <span
                class="code">sinalgo.models.ConnectivityModel</span> and place the
            source-file in the <span
                class="code">models/connectivityModels/</span> folder of your
            project. Instances of this model implement

            <br><span
                class="code codeTab"><strong>boolean</strong> updateConnections(Node n) <strong>throws</strong>
 WrongConfigurationException;</span>

            <br>which determines for a given node <span class="code">n</span> the
            set of neighbor nodes and returns whether the neighborhood has
            changed since the last call. This method needs to update the <span
                class="code">outgoingConnections</span> member of node <span
                class="code">n</span>, such that this collection contains an <a
                href="Implementation.html#Edges" class="nav_link">edge</a>
            to every neighbor of <span class="code">n</span>.

            <p>In synchronous simulation mode, each node updates its connections
                in every round. Refer to the <a class="nav_link"
                                                href="Implementation.html#Sync Call Sequence">synchronous
                    calling sequence</a> section of this tutorial for more details. For
                the asynchronous simulation, the framework does not support mobile
                nodes. As a result, the framework does not call the connectivity
                model at all, as it is often only necessary to setup the edges once
                after the nodes have been created. Thus, the project is responsible
                to call the following method at an appropriate time:<br>

                <span class="code
 codeTab">sinalgo.tools.Tools.reevaluateConnections();</span>

                <br> This method calls the <span
                        class="code">updateConnections(Node n)</span> method on all nodes.

            <p>To facilitate the implementation of a new connectivity model, you
                may create a subclass of <span
                        class="code">sinalgo.models.<strong>ConnectivityModelHelper</strong></span>. This
                helper class implements the <span class="code">updateConnections(Node
 n)</span> method, and asks the subclass to implement the method

                <br><span class="code codeTab"><strong>boolean</strong> isConnected(Node from,
 Node to);</span>

                <br> which is often easier to implement.

            <p>The <span class="code">ConnectivityModelHelper</span> assumes that
                the connectivity is geometric. I.e. there is a maximum distance
                between connected nodes, above which no node pair is connected. This
                assumption permits to drastically cut down the neighbor-nodes the
                helper class needs to test. <strong>Note</strong> that this maximum distance
                needs to be specified for each project. Refer to the <a class="nav_link"
                                                                        href="Configuration.html">configuration</a>
                and <a class="nav_link"
                       href="Architecture.html">architecture</a> section of this
                tutorial to learn more about how to configure a project and how the
                <em>geometric node collection</em> stores the nodes to perform range
                queries for neighbor nodes.

            <p>For your convenience, the <span class="code">defaultProject</span>
                already contains the following connectivity models. Note that these
                models are written as generic as possible. Therefore, you may need to
                add <a class="nav_link"
                       href="Configuration.html">configuration settings</a> to your
                project, depending on which model you select.

                        The Unit Disk Graph connectivity is a purely geometric connectivity

                        The Quasi Unit Disk Graph is similar to the UDG model, but does not
                        have a sharp upper bound on the transmission range. In the QUDG
                        model, a pair of nodes is always connected if their mutual distance
                        is below a certain value <span class="code">rMin</span>, and is never
                        connected if their distance is above <span
                            class="code">rMax</span>. If the distance is between <span
                            class="code">rMin</span> and <span class="code">rMax</span>, the
                        nodes are connected with a certain probability, which has to be
                        specified in the project configuration. See the source documentation
                        of the <span class="code">QUDG</span> class for more details.

            <p>In synchronous simulation mode, the framework performs the
                interference test in every round. Refer to the <a class="nav_link"
                                                                  href="Implementation.html#Sync Call Sequence">synchronous
                    calling sequence</a> section of this tutorial for more details. For
                asynchronous simulations, the interference test is performed whenever
                an additional message is being sent or a message arrived.

            <p><strong>Additive interference in asynchronous mode</strong>: By default, the
                asynchronous mode performs an interference test on all messages that
                have not yet arrived whenever an additional message is sent, or a
                message arrives. This is a quite expensive operation, and is not
                necessary in most cases, where the interference is
                <strong>additive</strong>. We call interference <em>additive</em>, if <br><span
                        class="codeTab">a) an additional message can only increase (or not
 alter) the interference at any other receiver node, and</span>
                <br><span class="codeTab">b) the interference decreases (or remains
 the same) if any of the messages is not considered.</span><br>

                If all used interference models are <em>additive</em>, the framework
                can reduce the calls to the interference test drastically. Additive
                interference can be enabled/disabled in the configuration file of the
                project.

            <p>For your convenience, the <span class="code">defaultProject</span>
                already contains the following interference models. Note that these
                models are written as generic as possible. Therefore, you may need to add
                <a class="nav_link" href="Configuration.html">configuration
                    settings</a> to your project, depending on which model you select.

                        The signal to interference model is probably the best known
                        interference model. It determines a quotient q = s / (i+n) between
                        the received signal s and the sum of the ambient background noise n and
                        the interference i caused by all concurrent transmissions. The
                        transmission succeeds if q &gt; beta, where beta is a small constant.
                        <br>
                        This model assumes that the intensity of an electric signal decays
                        exponentially with the distance from the sender. This decrease is
                        parameterized by the path-loss exponent alpha: Intensity(r) =
                        sendPower/r^alpha. The value of alpha is often chosen in the range
                        between 2 and 6.
                        <br>
                        To the interference caused by concurrent transmissions, we add an

            The mobility model on each node object describes how the node moves
            in the synchronous simulation. (Asynchronous simulation does not
            support mobile nodes.) To create your own mobility model, implement a
            subclass of <span class="code">sinalgo.models.MobilityModel</span> and
            place the file in the <span
                class="code">models/mobilityModels/</span> folder of your project.

            <p>The model requires to implement the method <span
                    class="code"><strong>Position getNextPos(Node n)</strong></span>, which returns
                the new position of node <span class="code">n</span>.

            <p>In Sinalgo, mobility is simulated in terms of rounds. At the
                beginning of each round, the nodes are allowed to move to a new
                position, where they remain for the remainder of the
                round. (Refer to the <a class="nav_link"
                                        href="Implementation.html#Sync Call Sequence">calling
                    sequence</a> for more details.)

            <p class="note"><strong>Implementation Note:</strong> The discretization of the
                movement may be refined in the following way: Assume a simulation,
                where nodes move 1 distance unit per round. At the same time, a
                message takes 1 round to arrive at its destination. To achieve a
                higher resolution of the movement, you may reduce the node speed to
                0.1 distance units per round, and increase the message transmission
                time to 10. Along this line, you may achieve arbitrarily close
                approximations to a continuous system, paying with simulation
                time. </p>

                        A node that moves according to the random way point mobility model

                        to.

                        alternates between waiting and moving periods. The only difference is
                        the choice of the target: Instead of picking a random point from the
                        deployment field, the random direction chooses a direction in which
                        the node should walk, and how long the node should walk in this
                        direction. If the node hits the boundary of the deployment area, it

            framework creates a set of nodes, there needs to be an instance of a
            distribution model that places the nodes. To create your own
            distribution model, implement a subclass of <span
                class="code">sinalgo.models.DistributionModel</span> and place the file
            in the <span class="code">models/distributionModels/</span> folder of
            your project.

            <p>The distribution models implement an iterator-like interface that
                allows to retrieve the node positions in sequence. The model requires
                to implement the method <span class="code"><strong>Position
 getNextPosition()</strong></span>, which returns the position of a
                node. The framework calls this method exactly once for each created node.

            <p><strong>Initialization:</strong> After creating an instance of the
                distribution model, the framework sets the member variable <span
                        class="code">numberOfNodes</span>, and then calls the <span
                        class="code">initialize()</span> method. This method may be used to
                pre-calculate the positions of the nodes and obtain an iterator
                instance on the positions. The positions are retrieved only after
                this call.

            <p>For your convenience, the <span class="code">defaultProject</span>
                already contains the following distribution models. Note that these
                models are written as generic as possible. Therefore, you may need to add
                <a class="nav_link" href="Configuration.html">configuration
                    settings</a> to your project, depending on which model you select.
