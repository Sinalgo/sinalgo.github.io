# Sinalgo - Simulator for Network Algorithms

## Welcome to Sinalgo

Sinalgo is a simulation framework for testing and validating network algorithms. 
Unlike most other network simulators, which spend most time simulating the different 
layers of the network stack, Sinalgo focuses on the verification of network algorithms, 
and abstracts from the underlying layers: It offers a message passing view of the network, 
which captures well the view of actual network devices. Sinalgo was designed, but is not 
limited to simulate wireless networks.
